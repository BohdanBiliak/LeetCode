# Longest Common Prefix (JavaScript)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Longest Common Prefix** algorithm in JavaScript.

## Problem
Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix among them.  
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

**Example:**
```text
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Complexity
```
**Complexity**
Time Complexity: O(S) — where S is the total number of characters across all strings (each character compared at most once).

Space Complexity: O(1) — uses only a constant amount of extra space.
